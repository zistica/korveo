"""Bearer-token authentication middleware (Slice 5B).

Default-off for localhost. When ``KORVEO_API_TOKEN`` is unset, every
endpoint is reachable without credentials **from loopback** — the
zero-friction localhost-dev story is unchanged. But an instance with
no token that is reachable from a non-loopback address refuses remote
requests (HTTP 403) instead of silently serving every trace, prompt,
and the firewall control plane to the network. Operators opt back into
the old wide-open behavior with ``KORVEO_ALLOW_INSECURE=1``; the right
fix is to set ``KORVEO_API_TOKEN``.

When ``KORVEO_API_TOKEN`` is set, every request to ``/v1/*``,
``/ws/*``, and ``/health/admin`` requires:

    Authorization: Bearer <KORVEO_API_TOKEN>

…or, for WebSocket connections that can't carry headers easily,
a query string ``?token=<KORVEO_API_TOKEN>``.

Exempt paths (always reachable, no token required):
  - ``/health``         the container healthcheck hits this
  - ``/openapi.json``   FastAPI's spec; needed by tooling
  - ``/docs``, ``/redoc``  same
  - ``/`` (root)        a minimal JSON identity card

Why a custom middleware instead of FastAPI's ``HTTPBearer`` /
``Security``? Two reasons:

  1. Token comparison must be **constant-time** to avoid timing
     attacks. ``hmac.compare_digest`` does that; the FastAPI
     security helpers don't.
  2. The off-by-default story needs to be a single env-var check
     — wrapping every router with a Depends would force every
     test to opt out individually.

The middleware is added in ``main.py`` after all routers are
registered. Order matters — auth must run BEFORE the router
matches the path, so it has a chance to 401 before the handler
fires.
