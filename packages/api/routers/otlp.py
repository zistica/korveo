"""OTLP/HTTP ingest endpoint — POST /v1/otlp/v1/traces.

Accepts OpenTelemetry trace exports in either protobuf or JSON
format and routes them through the same DuckDB write + WebSocket
broadcast + policy evaluation path that POST /v1/spans uses for
SDK-native ingest. The decode + translate logic lives in
``otlp_decode.py``; this module is the thin HTTP transport layer.

Why a separate endpoint instead of extending ``/v1/spans``:

  - OTel tools have a hard expectation about the URL shape
    (``/v1/traces`` for OTLP/HTTP). Reusing ``/v1/spans`` would
    require every operator to override an internal exporter URL.
  - Reading content-type, parsing protobuf, and producing the
    OTLP-shaped success response are concerns that don't apply to
    the SDK-native path.

Per ``Development_Rules.md`` Rule 7: a malformed batch must never
crash the API. We log + skip individual spans that fail to parse,
and return 4xx (not 5xx) for unrecoverable wire-format errors.

      - Anything else → try protobuf first, fall back to a 400 if

        send no Content-Type at all.

    Project resolution:
