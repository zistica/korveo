"""Agent-first observability — Phase 1 of the agent-card dashboard.

Treats the trace's `name` as the agent identity. Every distinct name
becomes an entry in the agent grid; the dashboard groups, ranks, and
links into the underlying traces.

This is intentionally a thin layer over the existing traces table —
no new schema, no new ingest path, no new DB writes. We surface
agents by querying what's already there. Future phases can promote
agent identity to a first-class column once the UX is validated.
