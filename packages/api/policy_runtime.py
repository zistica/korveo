"""Server-side Policy Engine — extends Accountability Layer Part B
to every Korveo integration regardless of language.

The Python SDK already evaluates policies in-process (fast feedback).
But Mastra, OpenClaw, VoltAgent, and any other framework that ships
spans through `/v1/spans` over HTTP can't take that path — there's
no Python in their address space. Solution: run the engine on the
API side too. Span gets ingested → engine evaluates → violations
land in the same `policy_violations` table the dashboard already
reads from.

Loaded once at API startup from the KORVEO_POLICY_FILE env var. If
the var isn't set, this module is a no-op — zero overhead, no
schema changes, no behavior change.

Per Rule 7, every entry point swallows exceptions. A broken policy
file or evaluation error must never block ingest.
