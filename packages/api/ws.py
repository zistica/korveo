"""WebSocket connection manager for real-time trace/span streaming.

Sync handlers (e.g. ingest_spans) call ``broadcast_threadsafe`` from a
worker thread; the message is hopped onto the running asyncio loop and
sent to every connected client. Failures (disconnected clients, slow
clients, no loop yet) are swallowed — broadcasts are best-effort and
must never affect ingest.
