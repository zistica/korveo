"""CI latency assertion for the synchronous decision engine
(§10.6 of AGENT_FIREWALL_SPEC.md).

Spec budgets (§2.4):
  - before_proxy_call : 50 ms
  - before_tool_call  : 50 ms
  - after_tool_call   : 100 ms
  - after_proxy_call  : 300 ms

We assert decide() stays well under the *before_tool_call* budget
under realistic conditions (10 enabled rules, simple regex
condition). 50ms is the budget; CI machines vary, so the gate is
20ms p99 — generous headroom that still catches a 10x regression.

The point of this test is to fail loudly if someone:
  - introduces a per-call DB query that wasn't there before,
  - forgets to sort policies by priority (linear → quadratic in
    chained-allow paths),
  - or registers a builtin that does I/O on every call.

The 1-second TTL cache on history builtins is what makes this
sustainable across ~thousands of decisions per second; without it,
each rule that calls session_total_tokens would hit DuckDB and
balloon p99 well past budget.
