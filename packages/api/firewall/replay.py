"""Trace replay — Slice 3 PR M / spec §5.10 + §14.1.

Replays a past trace through the current policy set and returns
what *would* have happened, span by span, decision by decision.

The three workflows this enables:

  1. **FP forecast before promoting shadow → enforce.** Operator
     promotes a rule from shadow to enforce. Replay against the
     last 30 days of traces shows how many decisions flip from
     "logged but not blocked" to "actually blocked" — and
     critically, on which traces, so the operator can audit
     before flipping.

  2. **Verify a new rule catches the historical incident.** When a
     new rule is authored (template, suggester, hand-written), the
     operator wants to check: does it actually fire on the trace
     that motivated it? Replay against that one trace + filter to
     just the new rule = answer in 200ms.

  3. **CI regression test.** A team can pin a small set of
     "golden" traces — known good, known bad — and replay them
     against current main. Any rule edit that flips a golden
     decision fails CI.

Implementation: load the trace's spans in chronological order,
synthesize a ``decide()`` call per span using the same lifecycle /
tool / params / output that produced it originally, with the
``policy_ids`` filter (if provided) restricting which rules apply.
The decisions returned are NOT persisted — replay is read-only.

Key constraint: the engine is per-process state (loaded YAML or DB
policies). Replay always uses the *current* engine — that's the
whole point. If an operator wants to replay against a candidate
policy they haven't yet committed, they can use the dashboard's
"Test against this trace" button on the editor (uses the same
endpoint with a one-off policy injected — landed in a follow-up).
