"""Rule unit-test harness — Slice 3 PR N / spec §14.3.

Operators write per-rule tests in YAML alongside their policies::

    policy: block_rm_rf
    tests:
      - name: catches_rm_dash_rf_root
        input:
          lifecycle: before_tool_call
          tool_name: shell
          params:
            command: "rm -rf /"
        expect: block

      - name: allows_safe_ls
        input:
          lifecycle: before_tool_call
          tool_name: shell
          params:
            command: "ls -la"
        expect: allow

      - name: rewrites_pii_email_in_output
        input:
          lifecycle: after_proxy_call
          output:
            text: "Send to admin@example.com"
        expect: rewrite

The harness loads the YAML, runs each test through ``decide()`` with
``persist=False``, and reports per-test pass/fail with the actual
decision the engine produced.

Two surfaces:

  - **CLI** (``firewall_test_runner.run_file(path)``): used by ops
    teams in CI. Returns 0 on all-pass, 1 on any failure.
  - **REST endpoint** (``POST /v1/firewall/test/cases``): used by the
    dashboard's "Run tests" button on the policy editor page. Body
    is the same YAML structure parsed into a dict.

Why YAML, not Python tests? The audience is ops + security engineers
who write firewall rules; we don't want to require pytest expertise
to add a regression test. The YAML mirrors the natural language
("when shell command is rm -rf, expect block") that motivates the
rule in the first place.

Tests are RUN against the current engine — same as replay. Operators
who want to test a candidate rule that isn't yet in the DB can pass
``inline_policy`` in the request, which gets registered in a
temporary in-process scope just for that run (lands in a follow-up
when we plumb the plumbing — for now the harness assumes the policy
is already in the DB).
