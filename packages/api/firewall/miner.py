"""Frequent-pattern miner — Slice 3 PR E / spec §11.3.

Background scanner that walks the recent ``decisions`` table looking
for clusters of similar decisions that didn't already trigger a rule
(or that triggered a noisy rule the operator might want to refine).
Surfaces clusters as ``pattern_suggestions`` rows with template=
``frequent_pattern`` so the dashboard can render them as drafts the
operator can promote with one click.

Why a separate miner from the per-violation suggester?

  - The per-violation suggester (Slice 3 PR D) is interactive — an
    operator clicks "Block this pattern" on one fired decision.
  - The miner is autonomous — it surfaces patterns the operator
    didn't even notice were happening. Compounding-loop bedrock:
    "your traces from yesterday become your blocking rules today".

Scope (intentionally narrow for v1):

  - Looks at decisions in the last 7 days.
  - Groups by (lifecycle, tool_name, normalised_command_first_word)
    where command is the first 80 chars of params.command (when
    present) or matched_value_truncated.
  - Emits a suggestion when a cluster has ≥ MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE
    decisions AND no existing pattern_suggestions row references
    the same cluster signature.
  - Cost-bounded per spec §19.9: runs at most every
    ``KORVEO_MINER_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` (default 3600s = 1 hour),
    skips when no new decisions since last run.

What the miner does NOT do (explicit non-goals):

  - Doesn't try to detect content drift / behavioral anomalies —
    that's §11.4 + §15.3.
  - Doesn't replay candidate rules against historical traces —
    that's Slice 4 trace-replay infrastructure.
  - Doesn't author conditions for clusters that span multiple
    lifecycles — single-lifecycle scope keeps the generated
    rules simple + correct.
