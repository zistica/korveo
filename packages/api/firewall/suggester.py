"""Pattern suggester — Slice 3 PR D / spec §5.5 / §11.

Operator clicks "Block this pattern" on a fired decision in the
dashboard; this module extracts a regex from the matched value,
drafts a Policy YAML around it, runs a 30-day back-test against
the decisions table, and returns everything the dashboard needs to
let the operator review before saving.

The "compounding loop" the spec keeps talking about: every observed
violation can be promoted into a rule with one click. No regex
authoring, no Python — just review the draft, check the forecast,
save in shadow.

Design notes:

  - Pattern extraction is deliberately conservative. We escape the
    matched value as a literal regex rather than trying to
    generalize. Operators who want broader patterns edit the rule
    after promotion.

  - The back-test counts decisions where the same policy_name fired
    in the last 30 days, NOT a re-evaluation of the new condition
    against historical traces. The latter would require running
    the new rule across thousands of stored spans and is deferred
    to Slice 4 (where we have the trace replay infrastructure).

  - Suggestions are persisted in the ``pattern_suggestions`` table
    so the dashboard can list pending suggestions, an operator can
    revisit a draft they didn't immediately promote, and the
    frequent-pattern miner (PR E) can reuse the same storage.
