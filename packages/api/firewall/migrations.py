"""Schema migrations for the Agent Firewall.

Implements §4 of ``docs/AGENT_FIREWALL_SPEC.md``. Idempotent — safe to
call on every startup. Existing ``policies`` table gets four new
columns; new tables are created if absent.

Why a separate module rather than appending to ``db.DUCKDB_SCHEMA``?

  - Keeps the firewall feature self-contained. If we ever ship a
    Korveo build without enforcement (regulated env, OSS-without-
    classifier), this file is the single switch to skip.
  - Idempotent ALTERs read better here than mixed in with the
    initial CREATE TABLE block in ``db.py``.
  - The firewall has more migrations coming (classifier artifact
    table, webhook delivery state, miner runs); centralising lets
    us evolve them without touching ``db.py`` again.

Called from ``db.Database._init_schema`` immediately after the
existing migrations finish.

# ingest violation pipeline doesn't silently break on upgrade.
