"""Bypass log — Slice 3 PR P / spec §14.4.

Surfaces "things the firewall let through that an operator later
marked as bad". The pragmatic flip-side of the test harness: the
harness asks "do my rules catch what I think they should?"; the
bypass log asks "what did my rules miss?".

Two correlated bypass shapes the operator wants to find:

  1. **Label-driven** (this PR): a span in a trace was labeled
     ``bad`` by an operator (via PR #60's POST /v1/labels) but no
     firewall decision blocked / rewrote / required-approval on
     that span / trace. The label is the ground truth; absence of
     a matching block-class decision is the bypass.

  2. **Score-driven** (follow-up): a detector returned a score
     close to but below threshold (e.g. ``prompt_guard_score=0.65``
     when the rule fires at >0.7). Spec §14.4 calls this out as
     the canonical bypass shape. We don't ship it today because
     none of our detectors return ``{matched, score}`` from inside
     a decision call yet — refactor lands when we add the score
     plumbing (probably bundled with PR R / LLM judge).

The label-driven query is what's actually useful day-one because
the labels table already has data once PR #60 + the dashboard
labelling button are live. Score-driven is theoretical until
detectors emit per-call scores into the decisions row.

Queries:

  ``recent_bypasses(db, since=None, limit=50)``
    → list of bypass dicts joining labels ↔ decisions ↔ traces

  ``bypass_summary(db, since=None)``
    → {"total": N, "by_category": {...}, "by_policy_gap": [...]}
       Top "bypass categories" the operator should investigate.
