"""Synchronous decision engine — heart of the Agent Firewall.

Implements §5.1 (`POST /v1/policy/decide`) and §10.1–10.3 (mode,
panic disable, circuit breaker). Stateless and import-safe; the HTTP
layer in ``routers/firewall.py`` owns request/response shapes and
DB connection plumbing.

Decision flow for a single request:

  1. Honor the global panic kill-switch — if set, return allow with
     reason="panic_disabled" and skip the engine entirely. (§10.2)
  2. Filter policies by ``lifecycle == request.lifecycle``, by
     ``circuit_breaker_state == 'ok'``, and (when ``request.agent``
     is set) by scope_agents membership.
  3. Sort by ``priority DESC`` so high-priority policies see the
     request first. Ties broken by name for determinism.
  4. Evaluate each policy's condition with a fresh simpleeval. The
     namespace is built from the request payload + the firewall
     builtins from ``firewall.builtins`` (stateless + history-backed).
  5. First non-allow decision wins; an explicit ``allow`` short-
     circuits remaining lower-priority policies.
  6. Apply mode: ``shadow`` records the decision but returns allow;
     ``flag`` records and returns flag; ``enforce`` records and
     returns the policy's action verbatim.
  7. Hard timeout per lifecycle (§2.4). If the wall clock exceeds
     the budget mid-loop, abort and return allow (Rule 7 — agent
     never blocks on Korveo).

Every error path returns allow. Internal exceptions are logged but
swallowed; the agent that called us never fails because of us.

# ---- session-level deny cache (Slice 2 Tier 1.5(b)) ----------------------
#
# When an operator denies a tool call, the LLM doesn't always
# learn — Slice 1 dogfood (2026-05-07) saw an agent retry the same
# rm -rf three times after a deny, asking the user to approve via
# fake /approve syntax each time. The cache short-circuits this:
# once a (session_id, tool_name, params_hash) is denied, subsequent
# decide() calls for the same tuple auto-deny in <1ms without
# touching the policy engine OR re-prompting the operator.
#
# Cache scope is intentionally narrow:
#   - Per-session: a deny for session A doesn't affect session B
#   - Per-tool: blocking shell rm -rf doesn't affect a fetch call
#   - Per-params-hash: the same exact command. A *different* shell
#     command with different params is re-evaluated normally
#     (operators have to approve each variation, not "approve all
#     shell commands forever for this session").
#
# TTL: 600s by default (matches require_approval timeout). Override
# with KORVEO_DENY_CACHE_TTL=N (seconds, 0 disables).
#
# Storage: in-memory dict, keyed by (session_id, tool_name, params_hash).
# Sized loosely — 100k entries is ~30MB at peak; we don't bound size
# yet because real-world session counts are bounded by retention
# (90d default) and each session's denied tuples are typically <10.

# ---- agent_feedback helper (Slice 2 Tier 1.5(a)) -------------------------
#
# When Korveo denies a tool call or LLM output, OpenClaw passes our
# decision through to the agent as a tool error string. Slice 1
# dogfood (2026-05-07) captured a live LLM reasoning trace that
# revealed four distinct misunderstandings:
#
#   1. The LLM thought the deny came from the user, not a separate
#      enforcement layer ("Denied by user").
#   2. It treated policy as user-controlled ("user gave permission?").
#   3. It hallucinated a fake approval prompt and showed it to the
#      user (`/approve rm -rf <command>`) — a social engineering
#      surface.
#   4. The error string was opaque — Korveo's policy_name + reason
#      never reached the LLM's reasoning context.
#
# ``agent_feedback`` is a string the plugin v0.4.x reads off our
# response and surfaces verbatim as the tool error. It's authored
# to be:
#   - Authoritative (cites policy name)
#   - Disambiguating ("platform-level, not user")
#   - Anti-hallucination ("Do NOT generate approval syntax")
#   - Action-directing ("Reply to the user that...")

# budget when echoed in tool errors.
