"""Drift detection — Slice 3 PR F / spec §15.3.

Daily scan that compares each rule's fire rate today against its
baseline from the previous 14 days. Anything > 3σ from baseline
gets flagged as drift — either the agent's behavior changed
(upstream prompt template tweaked, new tool added) OR the rule
needs tuning.

Drift signals are surfaced two ways:

  1. ``GET /v1/firewall/drift`` — current alerts (used by the
     dashboard banner)
  2. ``firewall_drift_alerts`` table — historical record so
     operators can spot trends

Statistical model (intentionally simple):

  - Daily fire counts per policy, last 14 days.
  - baseline_mean = mean of days [today-14 .. today-1]
  - baseline_stddev = stddev of those 14 days
  - z = (today_count - baseline_mean) / baseline_stddev
  - alert if abs(z) > sigma_threshold AND today_count > min_count
    (the min_count guard avoids alerting on policies that fired
    once today and zero times historically)

Why simple statistics over a learned model:

  - Predictable. Operators understand "fired 12x today vs avg 2x".
  - Cheap. Single SQL group-by, runs in <100ms even on years of
    data thanks to the decisions table being indexed on
    decision_at + policy_name.
  - Honest about its limits. A learned model would over-fit to
    the noisy signal we get from a small Korveo install. Slice 4
    can add Prophet/etc. once we have telemetry showing this is
    a bottleneck.

Cost-bounded per spec §19.9:
  - Single 14-day SQL window
  - Per-policy stddev computed in Python over an aggregated row
  - One INSERT per alert that didn't already exist today
