"""Microsoft Presidio integration — Tier 2.1 of SLICE_2_PLAN.md.

Semantic PII detection that complements the regex-pack shape detection
in ``regex_pack.py``. Presidio is heavier (it loads a spaCy NLP model
on first use, ~500MB resident) but catches semantic PII that pure
regex misses — most importantly **person names and addresses**, which
have no useful regex shape.

Design constraints:

  - **Optional dep.** Presidio brings spaCy + language models that
    inflate the install footprint substantially. Operators who don't
    want it shouldn't have to install it. If the import fails at
    module load time, ``available = False`` and the public functions
    return safe defaults — score 0.0, empty entity list. Rule 7: a
    missing classifier never blocks an agent.
  - **Lazy init.** ``AnalyzerEngine()`` instantiation is the slow
    step (~2s on a fresh process loading the spaCy model). Defer
    until first call so a server import that never evaluates a
    presidio-using policy doesn't pay the cost.
  - **Single shared engine.** Engine is thread-safe per Presidio
    docs and cheap to call repeatedly. We cache it module-locally.
  - **Conservative entity types.** PERSON, EMAIL_ADDRESS, PHONE_NUMBER,
    US_SSN, CREDIT_CARD, IP_ADDRESS, US_PASSPORT, US_DRIVER_LICENSE.
    We deliberately skip URL, DATE_TIME, NRP — those have high false-
    positive rates on agent traffic (most agent outputs include URLs
    and dates legitimately).
  - **Errors swallowed.** Bad input or analyzer failure → 0.0 / [].
    The detector must never raise into the policy engine.

Public API:

  - ``available: bool`` — module-level flag, False when import failed.
  - ``presidio_pii_score(text) -> float`` — max confidence across
    detected entities, 0.0 when none / empty / unavailable.
  - ``presidio_pii_entities(text) -> list[dict]`` — entities with
    ``{entity_type, score, start, end}`` for the dashboard view.
