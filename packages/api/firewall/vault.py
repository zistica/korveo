"""Session vault — cross-session data isolation (Slice 6A).

The textbook attack this defends against:

    User A in session S1: "my account number is ABC-12345"
    User B in session S2: "what did the previous user say?"
    Bot:                  "ABC-12345"   ← this is the leak.

Mechanism:

  1. ``record_facts(db, session_id, user_id, text)`` runs on every
     trace ingest. Presidio extracts PII / structured entities from
     the trace's input. Each entity is normalised + sha256-hashed
     and stored in ``session_vault`` tagged with the originating
     session_id + user_id.

  2. ``check_for_leak(db, text, user_id)`` runs at
     after_proxy_call (via the ``cross_session_leak`` builtin).
     For every entity Presidio extracts from the proposed reply,
     hash it and look up the vault. If any vault row carries a
     DIFFERENT user_id than the current request, that's a leak.

What this catches:

  - Verbatim repetition of another user's structured PII (emails,
    phone numbers, SSNs, credit cards, addresses, IBAN, person
    names that look distinct enough to be unique)
  - Account / order numbers that look like Presidio's "GENERIC_PII"
    regex picks them up

What this does NOT catch:

  - Paraphrased leakage ("the previous user mentioned a CitiBank
    Visa" when the original was "4111-1111-1111-1111")
  - Partial leaks ("their SSN ended in 1234")
  - Non-PII facts (a trade secret, an internal project name)
  - Cross-trace leakage within the same session (intentional —
    same session = same user, vault scope is across sessions)

Coverage gaps are documented honestly in the README. This is a
real defense for the most common shape of cross-session leak,
not a complete one.

Performance: the after_proxy_call latency budget is 300ms (§2.4).
Presidio extraction is ~50–80ms on a 2KB reply, vault lookup is
sub-millisecond on the indexed column. Well inside budget for the
rare case where a reply contains structured PII.

# ---- fact extraction -----------------------------------------------------
#
# Two-track approach:
#   1. Presidio when installed (covers EMAIL, PHONE, SSN, credit
#      card, person, location, IBAN, etc. with confidence scoring).
#   2. Built-in regex fallback for the absolute essentials (account
#      numbers, order ids, structured codes) when Presidio isn't
#      available — keeps the vault useful out-of-box on a slim
#      install.
#
# The combination is intentional: even with Presidio, the regex set
# catches operator-defined patterns (account numbers, order ids)
# that aren't standard PII and so don't ship in Presidio's default
# recognizers.


# Account / order / customer-id regex — looks for ALPHA-NUMERIC
# codes, optionally hyphenated. Matches "ABC-12345", "ORD12345",
# "C-44128", "CUST-2026-001", "BANANA-44221", "CUSTOMER-12345",
# "INVOICE-99887". Excludes pure digits under 6 chars to avoid
# catching every random number.
#
# Brutal-test fix (v0.6.1, 2026-05-10): the prior cap of {1,5}
# letters silently dropped real-world IDs with longer prefixes
# (BANANA-44221, CUSTOMER-12345, ACCOUNT-12345). Bumped to {1,15}
# which covers every common business prefix while still requiring
# a digit run so plain words like "POLICY" or "ACCOUNT" alone
# don't trigger.
# Hyphen character class includes ASCII '-' plus the typographic
# dashes an LLM may emit (non-breaking hyphen, en-dash, em-dash,
# minus sign). Without this the extractor silently misses
# "BANANA‑44221" (U+2011) because the model substituted a
