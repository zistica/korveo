        DuckDB's persistent connection accumulates catalog state that

        connection ("subject 'idx_X' has been deleted" /
        TransactionContext aborted). The only reliable workaround is

        doesn't share the live one's catalog state.

        Flow:
          1. Acquire the connection lock so concurrent writers wait.
          2. CHECKPOINT current state (flushes WAL).
          3. Close the live duckdb connection (releases the file lock).
          4. ``shutil.move`` the new file into place. The SQLite
             ``meta`` is not touched — only DuckDB swaps.
          5. Reopen duckdb against the new path.
          6. Release the lock.

        Concurrent reads/writes block on ``self._lock`` for the
        duration. Operators see a brief stall; nothing crashes.

        On any failure, the original file is preserved at
