/**
 * @korveo/openclaw-diagnostics — Korveo's deepest hook into OpenClaw.
 *
 * Two related but separate APIs in OpenClaw observe a model call:
 *
 *   1. `internalDiagnostics.onEvent` — the bus the bundled
 *      `@openclaw/diagnostics-otel` plugin reads. Carries timing,
 *      sizes, and provider IDs but the runtime never populates the
 *      `inputMessages` / `outputMessages` fields the OTel exporter
 *      tries to read, so the diagnostics-otel content-capture flag
 *      is effectively non-functional in 2026.5.x. Fixing that needs
 *      an upstream PR; meanwhile we route around it.
 *
 *   2. **Typed hooks** (`llm_input`, `llm_output`) — the registration
 *      surface used by trusted plugins. These DO carry full content
 *      (the user prompt, history, system-role text, assistant
 *      replies, usage) at runtime, which is exactly what an
 *      observability tool needs.
 *
 * This plugin uses (2). On every llm_input / llm_output we build a
 * Korveo SpanInput and POST to `/v1/spans`. The agent never blocks on
 * us — failures are swallowed and budgeted with a short timeout.
 *
 * Activation prerequisite: non-bundled plugins must opt into
 * conversation access, so the operator's openclaw.json must contain
 *
 *   "plugins": {
 *     "entries": {
 *       "korveo-diagnostics": {
 *         "hooks": { "allowConversationAccess": true }
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * The plugin's install step writes that for the operator; if it's
 * missing, OpenClaw silently drops the hook registration and we
 * never see content. The plugin warns once at startup if the flag
 * isn't set so the misconfiguration surfaces immediately.
