/**
 * Path D — per-sender workspace sandboxing.
 *
 * Cross-session leaks happen at the STORAGE layer, not the
 * outbound layer. If the agent writes user A's secret to a
 * shared MEMORY.md and later user B asks the agent, the LLM
 * reads the same file and recites the secret — no firewall on
 * the *output* side can prevent this without playing whack-a-
 * mole with hooks, channels, and SDK versions.
 *
 * The architecturally correct fix: sandbox file-system tool
 * calls per-sender. User A's writes go to
 * ``{workspaceDir}/_korveo/by-sender/{safe-A}/...`` and user B's
 * reads resolve relative to ``{workspaceDir}/_korveo/by-sender/{safe-B}/``.
 * The bot literally has no path to user A's data while
 * serving user B — the leak is impossible by construction.
 *
 * Why plugin-side (not server-side rule):
 *   - Path resolution is channel-agnostic and protocol-agnostic.
 *   - ``before_tool_call`` IS awaited and CAN return rewritten
 *     params. We modify the path in place before the tool runs.
 *   - No server round-trip per fs call → zero added latency.
 *
 * What this does NOT cover (yet — separate rules):
 *   - Tools that read from outside the workspace dir (e.g.
 *     web_fetch, http_get). Those leaks are different and need
 *     their own egress policy (see TENANT_ISOLATION_SPEC.md L1.5).
 *   - Subagent / nested-session sharing. Subagents inherit the
 *     parent's workspaceDir; sandboxing applies recursively.
 *   - Race between concurrent senders writing to the SAME
 *     sandbox directory — handled by per-call mkdirSync (atomic).
