"""Policy Engine — Accountability Layer Part B.

Korveo records what happened. The Policy Engine adds the question
"should this have happened?": developers define rules in a YAML file,
and the engine evaluates each rule after every span and trace ends.
Violations are surfaced as red badges in the dashboard, queryable via
``GET /v1/violations``, and optionally pushed to a webhook URL.

This module is import-safe even when ``simpleeval`` / ``pyyaml`` are
missing — the load helpers raise a clean error and the engine stays
disabled, per Rule 7 (agent must never fail because of Korveo).

Security note (Rule 7-adjacent):
    Conditions are arbitrary user-supplied expressions. We MUST NOT
    use ``eval()`` — that would let a policy file pwn the agent
    process. ``simpleeval`` parses the expression into an AST and
    only evaluates a closed set of operators + a small whitelist of
    functions (len, str, int, float, abs). Names like ``__import__``,
    ``open``, ``exec`` are not in scope and dotted attribute access
    is rejected by default.

@dataclass
class Policy:
    """One rule from the policy YAML.

    Fields match the YAML schema documented in the session prompt.
    ``webhook_url`` is optional; when missing, alerts fall back to the
    global ``alert_webhook`` configured via ``korveo.configure(...)``.

    ``scope_agents`` (Phase 3) limits the policy to a list of agent names
    (matched against ``trace.name`` — the agent identity in Korveo's
    Phase-1 model). Empty list = un-scoped = applies to every agent.

    Agent Firewall fields (added in Slice 1 of the firewall pivot,
    see ``docs/AGENT_FIREWALL_SPEC.md``) — all optional with
    back-compat defaults so older SDK users authoring rules without
    them keep the legacy post-ingest advisory behavior unchanged:

    - ``lifecycle`` selects WHEN the rule fires:
      ``post_ingest`` (legacy, default), ``before_proxy_call``,
      ``after_proxy_call``, ``before_tool_call``, ``after_tool_call``.
    - ``mode`` selects WHETHER the rule's action takes effect:
      ``shadow`` (record only, never block), ``flag`` (record as
      violation but don't block), ``enforce`` (do the real action).
    - ``priority`` orders rules within a lifecycle: higher fires
      first; an explicit ``allow`` short-circuits lower-priority
      rules.
    - ``on_timeout`` is the fallback when an approval round-trip
      exceeds its timeout: ``allow`` or ``deny``.
    - ``on_internal_error`` is the fallback when the engine itself
      errors during evaluation: ``allow`` (Rule 7 default) or
      ``deny`` for high-severity rules.
    - ``circuit_breaker_state`` tracks runaway rules — when set to
      ``tripped``, the rule is silently demoted to shadow until an
      operator resets it via the dashboard.
    - ``stream_behavior`` (after_proxy_call only) — controls how
      streaming responses interact with policy enforcement: ``flag``
      (default; record but never block; lossless UX), ``cancel``
      (close the SSE mid-stream — partial leak still possible),
      ``buffer`` (disable streaming for this lifecycle entirely;
      full enforcement, slower UX).
